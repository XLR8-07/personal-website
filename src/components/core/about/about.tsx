                        I&apos;m a Full-Stack Developer who loves turning complex ideas into elegant, scalable software. With 5+ years of experience across startups and tech-driven platforms, I&apos;ve built everything from fraud detection systems and analytics dashboards to browser extensions and real-time APIs.

                        My main stack includes React (Typescript, Next.js, Redux, Zustand), NestJS, PostgreSQL, and Python â€” but I&apos;m always exploring new tools that make development smarter and faster.

                        I&apos;ve also taught university courses (yes, including a full React Native class!), mentored thesis groups, and even launched a datathon or two. I care deeply about clean code, thoughtful architecture, and building things that actually help people.

                        Currently based in Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª â€” open to freelance work, side projects, or just geeking out over cool ideas.
